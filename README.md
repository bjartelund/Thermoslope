# Thermoslope
Thermoslope is now the main offering of the package. 
A simple webapp to take UV-VIS absorbance reading done over a time/temperature gradient to estimate temperature-dependent velocities, giving a single experiment estimate of the Arrhenius parameters and thus the thermodynamic parameters of the activation barrier. 
# Thermofit
Batch processing of enzyme kinetics data at different temperatures for generation of Arrhenius-plots
Adapted for .csv-data from qChanger6 ADL 050 for Cary60

Example usage:
./thermofit.py exampledata/191216-pLipA-2*
